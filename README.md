# 4 Card Feature

### Copyrights

I got this challenge from [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).  

### Process

I made this design by creating a ` .main-container ` to be used for setting _width_ for most screen sizes.  
I placed the ` <h1> ` and ` <p> ` inside ` <header> ` and gave it ` margin: 0 auto ` to have it horizontally centered.  
I created the 4 main cards using ` display: grid `, for the mobile view I switched it to  
```
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
flex-wrap: nowrap

```
I used ` position: relative ` on each grid area so that I can control where to place the icons using ` position: absolute `.  

### Summary

If you have any feedback please do share it as I find it very helpful and try to implement it in my next designs.
